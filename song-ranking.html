<h1>My favorite EDM songs of all time</h1>
<h2>From the most recent of tracks, to the songs that got me into electronic in the first play</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Au5 - Blossom</h3>
<p>Discovered this song in 2012, specifically this got me into Electronic heavily. I always had a taste for synths within music before so. However, to be honest I didn't really understand what was electronic music at this time. But this song, got me into how beautiful the genre really is.</p>
<h3>Chime - Zephyr</h3>
Recent favorite, probably the oldest Colour Bass song that I know of. Basically Au5 but massively more melodic and calm.
<h3>Kobaryo - Singularity at 2.64e+6 BPM</h3>
<p>Probably the most wild take on Novatone/Extratone to exist. Although, if you hate high pitched songs in particular, I would suggest you stay away, trust me.</p>
<h3>The Magic Show (On Your Knees : The Moment : Thrill Of The Fight)</h3>
<p>Just listen to the part between 4:41 till 7:20 within the song. Life changing, not really. But, it is certianly lovely!</p>
<h3>Vylet Pony - Scapeghosts (ft. Foozogz & PrinceWhateverer)</h3>
<p>The best chrous ever! Seriously. If you want good music, just listen to every song that Vylet Pony has ever made that is longer than 5 minutes. Pure gems.</p>

<p>I will be modifying this website as I go. I am pretty sure I can already create a CSS flexbox or simply modify the elements to fit within certian margins. And I will probably do that very soon. Thanks for viewing :)</p>
